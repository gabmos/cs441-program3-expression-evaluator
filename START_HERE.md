# 🎯 START HERE - CS 441 Program 3

**Student:** Gabriel Morais  
**Academic Level:** Senior, Computer Science  
**Assignment:** CS 441 Program 3 - Expression Evaluator with Environment

**Welcome!** This is your complete CS 441 Program 3 submission package.

**Important Note:** This project was developed with AI assistance (GitHub Copilot with Claude Sonnet 4.5). The AI helped accelerate development, but I provided requirements, reviewed all code, identified bugs, validated functionality, and ensured I understood every concept. The AI was a tool, not a replacement for learning.

## ⚡ Quick Start (2 minutes)

### 1. Run the Tests
```bash
cd /Users/galbmorais/program3
racket -e '(require "expression-evaluator.rkt") (run-tests)'
```
✅ All tests should pass

### 2. Try the REPL
```bash
racket run-repl.rkt
```

Then type:
```racket
'(define x (num 10))
'(add (id x) (num 5))
(env)
(quit)
```

## 💡 Key Insights to Mention in Video

### What Worked Well
- AI understood complex requirements from assignment
- Generated idiomatic functional Racket code
- Created comprehensive tests automatically
- Excellent at documentation

### What Needed Attention
- One subtle bug (mutable vs immutable hash)
- Important to understand generated code
- Cannot blindly trust AI output
- Verification still essential

### Big Picture
- AI is a powerful amplifier, not replacement
- New skills needed: prompting, reviewing, verifying
- Understanding fundamentals becomes MORE important
- Future focus: specification and validation
